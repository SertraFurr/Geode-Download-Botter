# Geode Download Botter

*A simple (and kinda crappy) bot for automating downloads increase on Geode. Because why not?*

```It is bad in case, could be considered abuse and lead to ban, but if you feel like it, use it```

## Description
This is a basic Python script that simulates download requests to a Geode Mod. It uses proxies to avoid detection. **Warning: the author knows it's shit. Use at your own risk. It might break, get you banned, or summon eldritch horrors. Probably not the last one.**

- **Purpose**: Boost the downloads number on a webpage (Yay)
- **Features**:
  - Proxy support (HTTP/HTTPS).
  - Interactive request count input.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+ (tested on 3.9, but who knows).
- `requests` library: `pip install requests`.
- A `proxies.txt` file with one proxy per line (format: `http://ip:port` or `https://ip:port`).

No other fancy deps. If it crashes, blame the proxies.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repo (or just the script file).
2. Create a `proxies.txt` file in the same directory:

```
http://123.45.67.89:8080
https://98.76.54.32:3128
http://proxy.example.com:80
```

- Get proxies from whatever you wish.
3. Install deps:
  ```
  pip install requests
  ```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
2. Use your brain.

## Disclaimer
- This is for educational/fun purposes only. Don't use it to cheat or whatever, you'll get banned xD.
- Open source? Sure, but it's so basic, why bother forking?
